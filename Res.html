              <p>
              I'm Xingchen Li, assembled in China and updated here as well. Before graduation from Tianjin University, I was ranked top 1 out of my 90+ peers. 
		      Yeah, that's one of the few highlights in my life. I majored in Microelectronics, while the major is more silimar to "Microelectronic Fabrication", 
		      and I do initially hold a hatrate to anything relates to materials and chemistry which are of necessity to fab process. Oh, I also hate knowledge
		      that requires strong memorizing process without logic. But later when I realize that fabrication, as well as circuits and systems and more advanced 
		      technologies (which I'm in interest), are so strongly correlated and even should be regarded integratedly, I abandoned my bias and accept the whole thing.
		      Maybe that's the most precious lesson I learnt during my undergraduate years.
	      <p>
	       I also received a Bachelor of Economics as a major from Nankai University. The reason is that Nankai Univ. and Tianjin Univ. are really close. At there, some very
		      basic financial principals and regulations are taught, but unlucky I've forgotten most of them. Maybe one day I'll pick up them? Who knows. Besides, I
		      play soccer and watch <a href="https://www.bundesliga.com/en/bundesliga">Bundesliga</a>, and always support
		      <a href="https://fcbayern.com/en">FC Bayern Munich</a>!
	      </p>
              <p>
		      I seldom hold great expectations to my life. As for what will happen, let's move forward and see.
